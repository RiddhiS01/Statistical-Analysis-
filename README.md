# Statistical-Analysis-Wholesale seller data
The wholesale distributor seeks to gain insights into their business operations through the analysis of annual spending data across different regions and channels. They aim to identify patterns, trends, and potential areas for improvement to enhance overall business performance. 
Goals of the Project

Descriptive Statistics: Summarize the data using descriptive statistics to provide an overview of spending patterns across regions and channels.
Identifying spending patterns: Determine which region and channel spend the most and the least annually to understand customer behaviour and preferences.
Analysing product categories: Describe and analyse the spending on the six different varieties of items across regions and channels to identify any trends or patterns. Assess the variability of spending on different items to identify the most and least inconsistent behaviours among the product categories.
Outlier Detection: Determine if there are any outliers in the data that may require further investigation.
Recommendations for Business: Based on the analysis, provide actionable recommendations to the wholesale distributor to optimize their operations, enhance customer satisfaction, and improve profitability. By addressing these goals, the wholesale distributor can gain valuable insights into their business operations and make informed decisions to drive growth and success. We are asked certain questions about the dataset that we will answer one by one in our report.
